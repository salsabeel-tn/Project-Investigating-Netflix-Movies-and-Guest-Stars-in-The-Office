## Project Description
In this project, I put into use the skills I gained to collect and analyse Netflix movies .csv data files  and check if the average duration of movies is decreasing over time.
Main Python functionalities and Libraries used:<br>
1)loops, lists, dictionaries.<br>
2) pandas data frames and pd vectorization methods.<br>
3) matplolib  for data visualization.<br>

I gained experience in an essential data science skill â€” exploratory data analysis. This will allow me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots I create of the data. <br><br>
Upon running the code on your Jupyter Notebook/IDE, you should be able to see the following plots:
 ## plot no. 1: <br> <br>

## plot no. 2: <br><br>
![plot2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60573989/129727279-959e92d0-6fc4-4e72-bcdf-05153ab377f6.png)
## plot no. 3: <br><br>
Same as plot 2, different genres are demonstrated with different colours here.<br>
Black: Horror <br>
Red: Romance <br>
Green: Adventure <br>
Blue: Animated <br>
