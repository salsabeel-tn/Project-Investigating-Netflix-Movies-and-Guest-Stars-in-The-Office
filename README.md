## Project Description
In this project I put into use the skills I gained to collect and analyse Netflix movies .csv data files  and check if the avarege duration of movies is decreasing by time, this project will also determine which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office" TV show.
main python functionalities and Libraries used:
1)loops, lists, dictionaries.<br>
2) pandas dataframes and pd victorization methods.<br>
3) matplolib  for data visualization.<br>

I gained experience in an essential data science skill â€” exploratory data analysis. This will allow me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots I create of the data. <br><br>
Upon running the code on your Jupyter notebook/IDE, you should be able to see the following plots:
 ## plot no. 1: <br> <br>
